Automating-Bank-Check-Extraction-from-Scanned-PDFs_Decmber_2024 
This project was assigned by the Infosys mentor during my Python internship.
About the Project:
This project is designed to automate cheque processing by efficiently extracting vital
information from scanned cheque images in PDF format using advanced optical character
recognition (OCR) techniques. The system retrieves essential details such as the payeeâ€™s
name, cheque number, account number, amount (in both words and figures), and bank
details. The extracted data is securely stored in a relational PostgreSQL database and
visualized using an interactive Streamlit dashboard, offering real-time analytics and insights.
